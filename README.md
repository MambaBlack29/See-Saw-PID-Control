# See-Saw PID Control
- Download the entire folder, and run on MATLAB
## Task Overview
- A ball is given on a see-saw at some initial position
- Objective is to make the ball move from that initial position to a final position on the see saw
- The controller to do so is made of a simple PID control system, with the central torque of the see-saw as the control variable
- The PID system lacks a formal Integral term with its constant, instead the external torque exerted by the ball is kept as a 'pseudo-integral' term
- For a more detailed explanation refer to [DOCUMENTATION](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DCXmGCbi5Zf7fhOyEo0CEilvz2VGqWxbR4mezLLdfbU/edit?usp=drive_link)
